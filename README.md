# ThermoPySim

A Python-based framework for simulating thermodynamic systems and processes.

## Features
- Simulates ideal and non-ideal gases.
- Models heat engines like Carnot, Otto, and Stirling cycles.
- Generates PV and TS diagrams for visualization.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install matplotlib pytest
   ```
2. Run the tests:
   ```
   pytest tests/
   ```
3. Explore the simulations by running the `src` modules.
